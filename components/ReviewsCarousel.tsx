I previously had a trauma related to a root canal treatment, but this time the entire procedure was completely pain-free. The clinic is very hygienic as well."

    review: "I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Sameer Gharat! I came in with 7 deep cavities and was honestly pretty nervous, but he made the entire process feel effortless. He was incredibly caring, patient, and made sure I felt comfortable every step of the way. Each visit was smooth, and he took the time to explain everything clearly without ever rushing. You can tell he truly cares about his patients and takes pride in his work. I’m so grateful to have found such a skilled and compassionate dentist — highly recommend!"

    review: "Superb experience. I have been receiving treatment from Dr. Sameer since last one year. My entire dental situation was explained beautifully before the treatment started. The entire process went smoothly. Utmost care was taken by everyone including Shruti, Dr. Nikita, and of course Dr. Sameer so that I received the best care. Care with personal touch. Highly recommended."
